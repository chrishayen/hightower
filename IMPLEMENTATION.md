## Server Behavior

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Basic STUN Server (RFC Section 12) | ✅ Implemented | Minimal compliant server |

| Error Responses | ❌ Not Implemented | Not essential for basic operation |

## Client Behavior

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Binding Request Generation | ✅ Implemented | Creates valid requests |
| DNS Resolution | ✅ Implemented | Supports hostnames and IP addresses |
| Transaction ID Matching | ✅ Implemented | Validates response matches request |
| XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS Parsing | ✅ Implemented | Extracts reflexive address |
| IPv4 Support | ✅ Implemented | Full support |
| IPv6 Support | ✅ Implemented | Full support |
| Retransmission (RTO) | ❌ Not Implemented | No retry logic |
| Authentication | ❌ Not Implemented | Not needed for public STUN servers |

## What's Missing

The implementation focuses on **Basic STUN Server** functionality (RFC Section 12). According to the RFC:

- Basic STUN servers **SHOULD NOT** use authentication (short-term or long-term credentials)
- Basic STUN servers **SHOULD NOT** use ALTERNATE-SERVER
- Basic STUN servers **MAY** use FINGERPRINT but **MUST NOT** require it

### Not Critical for Basic Operation

- **Authentication mechanisms** - RFC explicitly states basic servers should not use
- **Error responses** - Server ignores invalid requests rather than responding with errors
- **TCP/TLS/DTLS** - UDP is sufficient for basic operation
- **Retransmission** - Client can be wrapped with retry logic if needed
- **FINGERPRINT** - Optional integrity checking

### Potential Future Additions

- Error response handling for better debugging
- FINGERPRINT support for integrity checking
- TCP transport for reliability
- Retransmission logic in client
- SOFTWARE attribute for server identification

## Compliance

This implementation provides a **compliant Basic STUN Server** as defined in RFC 8489, Section 12. It implements the minimal required functionality for NAT traversal and public IP discovery.
